    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine quinoa and water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until quinoa is cooked and water is absorbed. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced zucchini, red and yellow bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and sliced red onion.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix minced garlic with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried oregano. Drizzle this mixture over the vegetables and toss until well coated.</li>
        <li>Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>In a large serving bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with the roasted vegetables.</li>
        <li>Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the salad and toss gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and crumbled feta cheese (if using).</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the quinoa salad warm or chilled.</li>
